# Titanium
A Minecraft mod that adds titanium items, wich includes titanium, titanium ore, titanium armor and titanium tools. </br>
# Info
If you want to modify the mod don't forget to run ./gradlew clean and ./gradlew build in the terminal. </br>
Then a folder named build will appear then open build\libs and there will be your mod(not the one with -source in its name).</br>
The titanium ore can only be found at the deepslate level in the overworld(between -80 and -10,usually at -45 and around it).</br>
It has a 1 to 2 ore drops chance(with fortune maybe 1-8).</br>
Unfortunately I'm not the best artist,so the titanium ore look a little bit like the deepslate.Hope you'll see it :).</br>
All the photos can be found in the src/main/resources/textures,  and the mod code can be found in the src/main/jave/net/sebi/firstmod.</br>
